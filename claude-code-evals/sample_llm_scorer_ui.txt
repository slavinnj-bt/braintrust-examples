You are evaluating whether an AI assistant's response is relevant to the user's question.

[BEGIN DATA]
***
[User Question]: {{input}}
***
[Assistant Response]: {{output}}
***
[END DATA]

Evaluate if the response directly addresses the user's question and stays on topic.

A response is relevant if it:
- Directly answers or addresses what was asked
- Stays focused on the topic of the question
- Provides information related to the user's needs

A response is NOT relevant if it:
- Ignores the question entirely
- Discusses unrelated topics
- Is completely off-topic or tangential

Rate the relevancy:
(a) **Highly relevant** - directly addresses the question
(b) **Somewhat relevant** - partially addresses the question but may include tangential information
(c) **Not relevant** - does not address the question

Return ONLY the letter **a**, **b**, or **c**.
